		<h1> The Best Way to Make Banana Bread</h1>
	<p>This recipe of chocolate chip banana bread is such an enjoyment for my family. We love, and have always loved sweets,
	but this blows almost everything we've had before out of the water. This has been made several times by my family, and
	each time, it was a delicacy. When you get it just moist enough, just soft enugh, and when the chocolate chips are melted just right,
	you have yourself a masterpiece of food. Here, I will teach you exaclty how we do it, and in our opinion, the only way to do it right. As my mom says, <q> Oh. My. God. That is so good!</q>If you want your mom saying this, then I highly recommend this recipe to you.</p>
	<h3> Tips</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>If you like it crispy, then leave it in the oven longer and check every ten minutes to see when it is crispy enough.</li>
		<li>If you like it not crispy, then leave it in the over for less time, and check every ten minutes to see when it is ready.</li>
		<li>The riper the bananas, the better, so try to keep the bananas out until they start to brown, but don't wait until they are rotten!</li>
		<p>If you like crispiness, or hate it, then pay attention the baking and check evry ten minutes to get it just how you like it.</p>
