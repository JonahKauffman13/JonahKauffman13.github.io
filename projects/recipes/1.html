		<h1> The Best Way to Make Banana Bread</h1>
	<p>This recipe of chocolate chip banana bread is such an enjoyment for my family. We love, and have always loved sweets,
	but this blows almost everything we've had before out of the water. This has been made several times by my family, and
	each time, it was a delicacy. When you get it just moist enough, just soft enough, and when the chocolate chips are melted just right,
	you have yourself a masterpiece of food. Here, I will teach you exactly how we do it, and in our opinion, the only way to do it right.
	As my mom says, <q> Oh. My. God. That is so good!</q> If you want your mom saying this, then I highly recommend this recipe to you.</p>
	<h3>Tips</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>If you like it crispy, then leave it in the oven longer and check every ten minutes to see when it is crispy enough.</li>
		<li>If you like it not crispy, then leave it in the over for less time, and check every ten minutes to see when it is ready.</li>
		<li>The riper the bananas, the better, so try to keep the bananas out until they start to brown, but don't wait until they are rotten!</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Instructions:</h2>
	<ol>	
		<li><strong>Prepare oven and pan.</strong> Preheat your oven to 325<sup>o</sup> for a soft, moist, crumb.
			Grease and line and 9x5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the long sides for easy removal.</li>
		<li><strong>Combine wet ingredients.</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the mashed bananas, melted butter, brown sugar,
			and granulated sugar until smooth.</li>
		<li><strong>Add eggs, yogurt, and vanilla.</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the Greek yogurt and vanilla extract.
			Mix until just combined.</li>
		<li><strong>Mix dry ingredients.</strong> In a separate bowl, which together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
		<li><strong> Combine wet and dry mixtures.</strong> Add the dry ingredients to the banana mixture, stirring gently with a rubber spatula until there are no streaks of flour left. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
		<li><strong>Fold in chocolate chips.</strong> Gently fold in the chocolate chips. If desired, reserve some to sprinkle on top.</li>
		<li><strong>Fill pan and top.</strong> Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan and smooth the top. Sprinkle the remaining chocolate
			chips over top.</li>
		<li><strong>Bake.</strong> Place the loaf pan in the preheated oven and bake for 55-75 minutes. The baking time can vary depending on your oven and pan. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center;
			it should come out with a few moist crumbs but no wet batter.</li>
		<li><strong>Cool.</strong> Let the loaf cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then use the parchment paper to lift it onto a wire rack. Allow
			it to cool completely before slicing and serving.</li>
		<li><strong> Enjoy!</strong> Slice, serve, then feast on this delicious treat!</li>
